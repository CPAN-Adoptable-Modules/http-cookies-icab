	* DEVELOPER'S RELEASE - the save() function does not work, but
	the load() function does (should, might, etc.).  I still do not
	understand the entire format, but I can pull out the stuff that
	HTTP::Cookies needs.

 * distribution cleanups: no need to upgrade
 * this is a non-developer release, although it might still have
 problems
